The ancient Roman orator Quintilian was the first to metaphorically refer to
 the combination of words as "woven fabric" in his "Principles of Speech". The
 term "textum" later evolved into the term "text". Nowadays, when choosing the
 term "text" for discussion, the subconscious has a certain directional
 understanding of both text and literature, which means that it agrees with the
 concept that text is a weaving material, that is, an aggregation of words or
 language that have internal connections with each other. This term is widely
 used in theory, dating back to the New Criticism movement. The text is
 highlighted as a literary work that removes the true existence of the reader,
 the world, and the author. In order to avoid ideological, political, economic,
 and even the author's desires and demands, "text reading" aims to purely seek
 independent meaning within the scope of text and language. Since the New
 Criticism movement, the concept of "text" has been used to describe a
 constructed literary subject.
